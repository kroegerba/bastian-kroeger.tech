The first idea I had for this website was hosting my own[Curriculum Vitae](https://bastian-kroeger.tech/curriculum-vitae).  
By using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with [Tactile Theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/tactile) I can provide an ad-free, no-fluff, device independent reading experience.
